# Minimal example of historical data parsing

## Input 

Random historical table picked from 1951 UP census

## Processing

`DocParse.ipynb` runs `layoutparser` and extracts lists to produce a
table. Here, we're interested in the 2nd numerical column (which is
population).

## Output 

Some errors, but much preferable to manual entry.
